                            <p>Riders have found just about every way to have fun in the dirt, from spending 
                                a great day riding at the track or trail, to competing in an organized event. 
                                Most are introduced to the sport through family or friends, and so their first 
                                taste is usually what’s offered them. Often, riders stick with what they are 
                                first shown because it’s their “first love” with the sport, because it’s the 
                                best type of riding in their area, or simply because that’s what their friends 
                                do.But even if you’re already participating in one discipline.
                            </p>
                            <p> Motocross is what most people visualize when they think of dirt bikes. 
                                It’s high speeds on rough, natural-terrain tracks also covered with man-made 
                                jumps, berms, and various obstacles. Most tracks have open-practice days and 
                                race days. Races begin with riders in a row and a starting gate is dropped—usually 
                                one that falls back toward the riders and is segmented so that any racer trying to 
                                jump the gate early gets hung up in it while the other racers take off. 
                            </p>
                            <p>A motocross race is actually made up of two races, called motos. 
                                Professional motos are 30 minutes plus two laps long. 
                                Amateur motos usually last between 12 and 20 minutes.
