                            <p>Yamaha Companie:Unique Yamaha developments like crossplane crankshaft technology and the use of 
                                exotic metals and high tech processes that led to our control-filled aluminium 
                                frames. All were introduced on the racetrack and have filtered down into the bikes 
                                you can own and ride on the street. Here you can find some of the key advancements 
                                that make riding our road bikes so much fun.

                            <p>Honda Companie: Honda was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated 
                                luxury brand, Acura, in 1986. Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle 
                                businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal 
                                watercraft and power generators, and other products.
                            </p>
                            <p>Suzuki is best known in the United States and Europe as a manufacturer of small,
                               fuel-efficient cars and sport-utility vehicles, as well as powerful motorcycles,
                               although it moved into the midsize car sector during the 2004 model year with 
                               the introduction of the Verona. In its home market of Japan, however, the 
                               company is the leading maker of "minicars"--a classification almost unknown 
                               outside Japan. These tiny automobiles--smaller than American subcompact models--
                               are popular because of the tremendous overcrowding in Japanese cities, where 
                               since the early 1990s a larger car cannot be purchased legally until the owner 
                               can show proof that he or she has a parking spot.
